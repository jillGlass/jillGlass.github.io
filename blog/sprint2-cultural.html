        My Learning Plan

          What is your long-term goal and or career pathway?
          </h4>
            <p class="blog-entry-container">
              Become a web dev at a company I’m proud to work for. Once I have that I want to build up my experience enough to take on remote work so that I can work from home and work while travelling.
              Ideally, I’d like to work 4 days per week with flexible hours to fit in with family life but understand that may not be possible to begin with.
            </p>

          <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
          What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
          </h4>

            <p class="blog-entry-container">
              I’d like to increase my ability to take criticism and learn how to use criticism positively; become more robust against failure and mistakes; learn how to handle conflict within a team or one-on-one relationships; improve my ability to converse in the mornings – aka become a morning person! Learn problem solving skills, such as seeing a problem or occurrence from all sides and perspectives and also learn how to think outside the box more.
            </p>

          <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
            Describe your strengths and limitations.
          </h4>

            <p class="blog-entry-container">
              After doing some self-analysis and using online tools I believe that my strengths can be defined as: Self-Believer - I have inner confidence and self-motivation; Deliverer - I follow through on what I say I’m going to do. Once I start a task, I finish it; Philomath - I love learning new things (that I’m interested in!) and Believer - My objective is to believe and to do 'the right thing'. I have a certain set of values I am not ready to compromise. My values guide my life’s direction. <br> <br>
              My limitations are that I’m not very good at taking criticism and can be too sensitive. I avoid confrontation and conflict and I also internalise client problems or work problems as mine own personal problems and not solely ‘work’ problems, which can make me overly worry about things that went wrong.  I am not comfortable with failure or making mistakes as I’m yet to work in a workplace that doesn’t look down on these.
            </p>

          <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
            How will you manage your workload with the EDA team and fellow students? Based on your discoveries about yourself, how will you commit to this course?
          </h4>

            <p class="blog-entry-container">
              I don’t like to cause conflict and feel bound to deliver what I say I’m going to; therefore, I have huge motivation to not only complete this programme but to have put my upmost in to it. I like to finish things I start and do them well, there’s no point doing it if you don’t do it properly. 
              <br><br> I will manage my workload with the help of my facilitators and family.  My family understands the time commitment I have made during bootcamp and I have my parents and in-laws to help with my children. I plan on doing study in the evening as well, to allow me to see my kids over dinner. If I am stuck, instead of using hours trying to become unstuck, I will use Toggl to manage my time and ask facilitators for direction.
              <br><br>
              I have 20 years of experience working in teams and have attended several tertiary institutions in the past, so I will draw on that experience to work productively and safely with others. To destress, I plan on using yoga and walking with podcasts to ‘get out of my head’ and relax. I’ve also learnt over my lifetime to ask for help and direction instead of being lost.
