        What are the differences between HTML and CSS?
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-entry-container">
            I will use the analogy of a theatre play.  The HTML is the actors.  They stand around on stage saying their lines, sometimes saying them louder or quieter but not being very exciting.  They get the plays meaning across to the audience but it would be great if there was some pizzaz added.  This is where the director comes in.  The CSS is like the director, who tells the actors what to do and where to stand.  The director can also tell the actors what to wear, where to be, when to change what they are doing or saying.

        How is Emotional Intelligence different to IQ?
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-entry-container">
            EQ describes emotions, feelings and being aware of one’s own, as well as someone’s ability to interact and relate with others, whereas IQ describes intelligence and someone’s abstract thinking and logical reasoning ability when compared to the statistical norm.

        What are functions and why are they useful?
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-entry-container">
            Functions are a set of statements that perform a task in javascript.  Functions consist of a name, any parameters, and a block of statements to be executed.  Functions are useful as they can be used over and over again, by calling the function name. By reusing functions you simplify your code and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), a mantra used by developers.  Below is an example of a simple function that takes two parameters (number1, number2) and adds them together.  By calling the function doSomeAddition(5,5) with the arguments of 5 and 5, we are asking the function to add 5 + 5 together and return the answer.<br><br>
