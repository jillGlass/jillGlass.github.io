        Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
       </h3>
        <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
        How does understanding the principals of neuroplasticity benefit people?
        </h4>
          <p class="blog-entry-container">
            Understanding the principals of neuroplasticity benefits people as once understood, it gives people of sense of how they are in charge of their brain structure and that they can form new pathways and learn new things that they may have written off as being in the too hard basket.  Prior to understanding how brain plasticity works, many people believe that their intelligence levels are set from birth or adolescence.  What neuro plasticity studies show us is that this is not true. The brain has the ability to form new synaptic connections, be it from learning, experience or from following an injury. Understanding the principals of neuroplasticity enables people to take charge of their learning and learn new things.
          </p>

        <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
        How can I engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for my own benefit?
        </h4>
          <p class="blog-entry-container">
            The principals of neuroplasticity have affected me and allowed me to understand that because I think and feel like I may not be good at certain subjects, for instance math, it doesn't mean that I am not. It's just that I haven't concentrated on building and strengthening those neural pathways.
            When I first became interested in coding, a book I had read (Peak) and the term 'deliberate practice' was at the forefront of my mind.  I knew that I could build new neural pathways which would enable me to learn JavaScript and other languages. 
            Other than coding, the knowledge of brain plasticity can be used throughout my life, from learning to be a better snowboarder through to how I positively manage the relationships that I have.  If you repeat a wanted behaviour over and over it will strengthen the pathway and your brain will remember it.  The same goes for the reverse, if there is a bad habit I have, I need to remember that if I disengage from that habit then those pathways will be trimmed and the habit should fall away.
          </p>
        <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
        </h4>
          <p class="blog-entry-container">
            When you practice it needs to be deliberate practice. By this I mean that you need to be learning something harder than the time before.  If you continue doing things you already know you won't get any better.  Exercise increases neuroplasticity (also specifically learning and memory) and getting enough sleep is important for brain function. You also need to use it or lose it, to keep doing what you want to learn so that these pathways strengthen and don't get pruned.
            It's recommended to set meaningful goals and remember to do something like yoga or meditation to clear you head, which have shown to help with neuroplasticity.

        What is growth mindset and why is it relevant?
        </h4>
          <p class="blog-entry-container">
            Growth mindset is the belief that when you put in the effort, you can succeed, as you acknowledge that your brain is something that is malleable and can be strengthened. This is opposed to fixed mindset, when you believe that your intelligence is set from birth or childhood and can't be changed.
            It is relevant as studies show that when children recognise that they are able to strengthen their brain if they put in the effort, then they put in the effort and their grades go up.  Students who aren't exposed to this knowledge can start thinking that they aren't good enough at something and they give up, thinking they are unable to learn more.
            It is also relevant for the general population.  People may believe that they aren't good at math or don't have the right body for gym work.  With a growth mindset, you an overcome these problems by putting in the effort to strengthen your neural pathways.  Having a growth mindset allows people to take charge of their lives and become aware that knowledge is attainable, with the right effort.
          </p>
        <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
        When researching growth mindset did anything suprise you or change for you?
        </h4>
          <p class="blog-entry-container">
            The concept of 'yet' was inspiring.  I usually think of this term and growth mindset with regards to my children and how to get them positive about learning harder things.  Exploring this concept with EDA in mind made me realise that it also applies to me.  I'm not excellent at JavaScript, yet.
          </p>
        <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h4>
          <p class="blog-entry-container">
            I will use growth mindset as a mantra.   I think it will help to have the knowledge that it is possible to learn new things that we didn't previously think we were good at.  It underlines the message of always believing in your skills and ability to learn new things.  We just don't know things, yet.  My brain is malleable and it can grow therefore I can learn JavaScript!
          </p>

        <h4 class ="blog-sub-title">
        How will these understandings shape or influence your learning plan and strategy?
        </h4>
          <p class="blog-entry-container">
            I understand that I am building new neural pathways and that it will require a lot of effort on my part.  I understand that it isn't going to be easy and that I will need to practice a lot, to build strong neural pathways.  If something is difficult, I will not give up, I will use my resources to find the answer or complete the task.  This effort, while it may seem challenging and not very enjoyable at the time, is invaluable.  The hard effort is building the new pathways.
            It has also made me understand that learnt knowledge is easily lost.  The moment I finish EDA I need to keep coding - everyday - so that my new neural pathways don't get 'trimmed'.  I need to keep them strong and engaged, even once employed.
