        I'm Jill Glass, an Enspiral Dev Academy Student
      </h3>
      <p class="blog-entry-container">
        <strong>Contact Me</strong> glass.nz@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />I'm
        changing careers. <br />
        <br />
        From Marketing Manager to Web Development. I'm a mother and partner and
        am taking charge and redirecting my life. <br />
        <br />
        While I have over seven years of marketing experience under my belt, I
        have decided - after taking a break to raise my children - to redirect
        my career. The first step towards this was to enrol with Girl Code to
        gain some insight and experience into the dev world and solidify the
        direction I wanted to take myself. After Girl Code level 1 and level 2 I
        enrolled in Dev Academy, taking my career full-circle: at 18 I studied
        Multimedia (read HTML) at SEO in Auckland. 20 years later I am back on
        that track and am very excited about the future of my career.
